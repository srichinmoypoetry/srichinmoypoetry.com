<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More short poems on happiness by Sri Chinmoy. </strong></p>
<p>These poems are taken from the series of poetry &#8211; <em>Seventy Seven Thousand Service-Trees</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>311.<br />
To begrudge the happiness<br />
Of others<br />
Is to delay one&#8217;s own happiness<br />
Indefinitely.</p>
<p>479.<br />
Not the happiness<br />
That comes and goes,<br />
But the silence-fulness<br />
That comes and never goes<br />
Is what I need.</p>
<p>618.<br />
If you want to be happy,<br />
Really happy,<br />
Then you must needs keep<br />
Simplicity, sincerity and purity<br />
In your life-environment.</p>
<p>771.<br />
God dearly loves<br />
Your constant refusal<br />
To be unhappy.</p>
<p>1,088.<br />
To my extreme happiness,<br />
My Lord has come to tell me<br />
That from now on<br />
I must stand apart from my actions,<br />
Divine and undivine.<br />
He alone is the Doer;<br />
I am a mere observer.</p>
<p>1,330.<br />
Every day I pray to God<br />
To give me the capacity to fulfil Him,<br />
And not for a happiness-harvest-life.</p>
<p>2,978.<br />
My heart&#8217;s happiness<br />
Is my life&#8217;s<br />
Disobedience-bulldozer.</p>
<p>3,551.<br />
I am happy and fulfilled<br />
Because I have learnt<br />
To face life<br />
As it is.</p>
<p>3,642.<br />
Where does hypocrisy come from?<br />
Hypocrisy comes from<br />
Our exorbitant greed<br />
For our own happiness.</p>
<p>3,741.<br />
Do you want to be happy?<br />
Then force your mind to be<br />
Inside the breath of your heart.<br />
This is the only way<br />
To keep yourself happy.</p>
<p>3,911.<br />
How to achieve happiness?<br />
Not by giving, not by talking,<br />
But by being.</p>
<p>4,160.<br />
Do you want to be happy,<br />
Really happy?<br />
Then just think<br />
Of your outer life less,<br />
A little less,<br />
And live more,<br />
A little more,<br />
In your inner life.</p>
<p>4,349.<br />
My faith<br />
In God&#8217;s Forgiveness<br />
Is my firmly rooted happiness.</p>
<p>4,606.<br />
If you want to remain happy,<br />
Always follow the starlit footsteps<br />
Of your soul.</p>
<p>4,672.<br />
The very thought<br />
Of my Master&#8217;s happiness-smile<br />
Carries me far beyond<br />
My life&#8217;s sadness-river.</p>
<p>4,850.<br />
If you want to be<br />
Unimaginably happy,<br />
Then be an unconditional<br />
Smile-giver.</p>
<p>4,949.<br />
Today I am so happy<br />
And proud of myself<br />
For being a member<br />
Of the ignorance-demolition-team.</p>
<p>5,066.<br />
The happiness we discover<br />
In our tranquility-mind<br />
Is an unparalleled achievement.</p>
<p>5,400.<br />
My heart declined the invitation<br />
From my desire-mind,<br />
And I have become now<br />
The happiness-prince.</p>
<p>5,455.<br />
If we look with the mind&#8217;s eye,<br />
We shall see and feel no happiness<br />
In this world.</p>
<p>5,464.<br />
How do I love humanity?<br />
I love humanity through<br />
My soul&#8217;s inner happiness.</p>
<p>5,501.<br />
If we cannot transform<br />
The ingratitude-mind-dragon,<br />
Then we shall not have<br />
Abiding happiness<br />
In our life.</p>
<p>5,559.<br />
Finally I have decided that I must join<br />
An ignorance-weight-loss programme<br />
To make myself happy and perfect.</p>
<p>5,579.<br />
Ignorance-night and wisdom-light<br />
With equal happiness<br />
Course through me.</p>
<p>5,773.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is an inner journey<br />
From one world to another.</p>
<p>6,079.<br />
Happiness is not<br />
A matter of chance.<br />
We must cultivate happiness<br />
By virtue of our prayers<br />
And meditations.</p>
<p>6,150.<br />
My happiness-life<br />
Is in my heart&#8217;s<br />
Aspiration-field<br />
And nowhere else.</p>
<p>6,267.<br />
Only a happy heart<br />
Finds God&#8217;s blessingful Presence<br />
Everywhere.</p>
<p>6,279.<br />
When I am exceedingly happy,<br />
My Lord tells me that my life<br />
Is nothing short of perfection.</p>
<p>6,863.<br />
I do not calculate<br />
Happiness.<br />
I only cultivate<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>7,012.<br />
Who else can and shall sail<br />
My happiness-life-boat,<br />
If not myself?</p>
<p>7,042.<br />
God&#8217;s Forgiveness<br />
Happily finances<br />
My self-transcendence-journey.</p>
<p>7,056.<br />
A happy heart sees and feels<br />
God&#8217;s Heart everywhere<br />
And in everybody.</p>
<p>7,398.<br />
My soul makes my Lord happy<br />
By smiling with Him<br />
At His creation.</p>
<p>7,407.<br />
If my happiness is sincere,<br />
My Lord Supreme<br />
Multiplies my strength<br />
Immediately.</p>
<p>7,586.<br />
My heart wants me to be<br />
A denizen of God&#8217;s<br />
Happiness-heart-world.</p>
<p>7,763.<br />
Real happiness can blossom<br />
Only in the total absence<br />
Of a desire-life.</p>
<p>7,922.<br />
Happiness comes to me<br />
When<br />
I am unconditionally receptive.</p>
<p>7,928.<br />
A happy life is the clear indication<br />
Of a tamed mind<br />
And disciplined thoughts.</p>
<p>7,933.<br />
Those who do<br />
The homework of their lives<br />
Happily, willingly and proudly<br />
Will be the chosen instruments of God.</p>
<p>7,997.<br />
It is not a difficult task<br />
To make my Lord Supreme happy.<br />
He just asks me to smile and smile,<br />
And never to stop.</p>
<p>8,013.<br />
Where do I live?<br />
I live in the soul<br />
Of my happy heart.</p>
<p>8,014.<br />
My Lord Supreme tells me that<br />
To make Him happy<br />
I must love His creation first.</p>
<p>8,636.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is extremely proud of living inside<br />
Divine thoughts.</p>
<p>8,703.<br />
Life’s surrender<br />
And the heart’s happiness<br />
Are always interchangeable.</p>
<p>8,778.<br />
Judgement does not have<br />
The capacity<br />
To give us true happiness,<br />
But illumination does have<br />
The capacity.</p>
<p>8,896.<br />
My mind, be not miserable<br />
All the time.<br />
Do a little bit of self-offering.<br />
Immediately<br />
Happiness will beckon you.</p>
<p>8,914.<br />
If our happiness<br />
Is not mutual,<br />
It is meaningless<br />
And worthless.</p>
<p>8,953.<br />
The judgement-seat<br />
Rarely embodies<br />
Happiness-smile.</p>
<p>9,268.<br />
O my inner happiness,<br />
Let everybody desert me.<br />
I won&#8217;t mind.<br />
But you must never desert me,<br />
I beg of you.</p>
<p>9,424.<br />
My Lord is so happy<br />
That my heart-peace<br />
Is portable all-where.</p>
<p>9,594.<br />
When I am happy<br />
In my Lord&#8217;s Name,<br />
My inner life is safe<br />
And<br />
My outer life is strong.</p>
<p>9,667.<br />
My Lord, I wish to pray<br />
Only for Your Fulfilment<br />
And not for my own<br />
Lasting happiness.</p>
<p>9,707.<br />
God is extremely happy with me,<br />
God is extremely proud of me<br />
Precisely because I have narrowed down<br />
My long desire-list at long last.</p>
<p>9,944.<br />
If you do not stop regretting<br />
And grieving,<br />
How do you expect to receive happiness<br />
Either from God the Creator<br />
Or God the creation?</p>
<p>9,981.<br />
Action and happiness<br />
May not follow each other,<br />
But a God-surrender-life<br />
Is both action in happiness<br />
And happiness in action.</p>
<p>10,031.<br />
The divine love says to the world:<br />
“I am yours.<br />
I am your oneness-heart.<br />
To make you happy is all I want.”</p>
<p>10,342.<br />
I am happy<br />
When I meditate<br />
All by myself.</p>
<p>10,343.<br />
I am happier<br />
When I meditate<br />
In front of my Master divine.</p>
<p>10,344.<br />
I am happiest<br />
When I meditate<br />
Only for my Lord&#8217;s constant Victory.</p>
<p>10,417.<br />
The happiness of a surrender-life<br />
Can easily take off<br />
The depression-pounds of the vital.</p>
<p>10,470.<br />
Unless I feel the touch<br />
Of my Lord&#8217;s Feet inside my heart,<br />
How can I ever be happy and fulfilled?</p>
<p>10,471.<br />
God&#8217;s Compassion<br />
Is constantly blossoming<br />
In my heart<br />
Only to make my life happy.</p>
<p>10,529.<br />
God invites us to swim<br />
In the river of happiness<br />
When we pray to Him<br />
To give us the capacity<br />
For the manifestation of His Fulness.</p>
<p>10,534.<br />
The difference between me and my mind<br />
Is this:<br />
My mind is a greedy possessor,<br />
And I am a happy renouncer.</p>
<p>10,672.<br />
What a sweet happiness beckons us<br />
When we see that we are only for<br />
The fulfilment<br />
Of our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>10,695.<br />
If there is no inner happiness-wealth,<br />
How can there be proper<br />
Outer manifestation<br />
Of our Beloved Lord?</p>
<p>10,868.<br />
A happy life<br />
And<br />
A worried mind<br />
Are not visible together.</p>
<p>10,968.<br />
God wants me<br />
To fly<br />
With my heart&#8217;s happiness-smiles.</p>
<p>11,070.<br />
Those who are happy<br />
In the heart<br />
Will find God<br />
The rich.</p>
<p>11,071.<br />
Those who are unhappy<br />
In the mind<br />
Will find God<br />
The poor.</p>
<p>11,146.<br />
God is not a strict disciplinarian.<br />
No, never!<br />
His Philosophy is very simple:<br />
If you want to be truly happy,<br />
Then there is only one way&#8211;<br />
Make God happy first.</p>
<p>11,159.<br />
God the Happiness<br />
Is all love<br />
For a humility-life.</p>
<p>11,193.<br />
I am mistaken if I think<br />
That God is only inside<br />
My happiness-heart.<br />
God is also inside<br />
My misery-stricken mind.</p>
<p>11,255.<br />
If you want to be happy<br />
And remain happy,<br />
Then sing all the God-surrender-songs<br />
That you have come to know.</p>
<p>11,277.<br />
Sleepless happiness<br />
Brightens and enlightens<br />
My earth-journey.</p>
<p>11,367.<br />
I am happy,<br />
Infinitely happy,<br />
Only when I am lost<br />
In the sky of dreams.</p>
<p>11,373.<br />
The heart has to be<br />
Always a happy flood of love<br />
For God.</p>
<p>11,379.<br />
God&#8217;s Compassion-Eye<br />
Happily and proudly<br />
Gives shelter<br />
To my homeless heart-cries.</p>
<p>11,406.<br />
Happiness-kingdom<br />
Is well guarded<br />
By oneness-peace.</p>
<p>11,460.<br />
There is no other way to thrive<br />
Than to strive<br />
Happily and sleeplessly.</p>
<p>11,572.<br />
When I am happy,<br />
God tells me<br />
That I am supremely good.</p>
<p>11,573.<br />
When I am happier,<br />
God tells me<br />
That He will share<br />
Some of His absolute Secrets<br />
With me.</p>
<p>11,574.<br />
When I am happiest,<br />
God tells me<br />
That He has decided to make me<br />
His representative here on earth.</p>
<p>11,583.<br />
If you can not carry<br />
Your inner happiness everywhere,<br />
Your outer life will remain<br />
Terribly unbalanced.</p>
<p>11,890.<br />
A happy heart<br />
Is definitely an indication<br />
Of a disciplined mind.</p>
<p>11,683.<br />
We must take<br />
A  happiness-walk,<br />
Not inside the confusion-mind<br />
But inside the illumination-heart.</p>
<p>11,689.<br />
When I pray and meditate,<br />
Happiness dances<br />
Inside the Heart<br />
Of my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>11,768.<br />
Happiness lies always<br />
On the path<br />
Of God-serving opportunity.</p>
<p>11,870.<br />
I know, I know,<br />
My happiness comes solely<br />
From my God-serving duty.</p>
<p>11,890.<br />
A happy heart<br />
Is definitely an indication<br />
Of a disciplined mind.</p>
<p>12.023.<br />
Go beyond the domain<br />
Of the mind.<br />
You will be able to shine<br />
In the galaxy<br />
Of happiness-stars.</p>
<p>12,081.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is of supreme importance.<br />
When I am really happy,<br />
I have no time<br />
To find fault with others.</p>
<p>12,082.<br />
When we are unhappy,<br />
We speak ill of others<br />
And do things we should not do.</p>
<p>12,089.<br />
Unhappiness<br />
Is always apt to speak ill<br />
Of others<br />
And to try<br />
To destroy others.</p>
<p>12,090.<br />
Only happiness<br />
Has the capacity<br />
To accept the whole world<br />
As its own, very own.</p>
<p>12,105.<br />
Alas, we are begging our unhappy mind<br />
To make us happy.<br />
Let us knock at our heart-door,<br />
The right door,<br />
Which can and shall make us happy.</p>
<p>12,108.<br />
If we are happy<br />
With our achievement,<br />
We have to give gratitude<br />
To the One<br />
Who has invisibly prepared us<br />
Inwardly.</p>
<p>12,134.<br />
Every day my Lord asks me<br />
Only one thing:<br />
“What do you think<br />
Will make you happy,<br />
My child?<br />
I shall give it to you.”</p>
<p>12,210.<br />
My heart is truly happy<br />
When it considers others to be<br />
Better, higher and wiser.</p>
<p>12,222.<br />
I am mightily happy<br />
When I honour others<br />
Far above myself.</p>
<p>12,229.<br />
My mind,<br />
Do not try to complain,<br />
Do not try to explain.<br />
You will be unimaginably happy.</p>
<p>12,236.<br />
Happiness lost<br />
Can be regained<br />
By sincerely loving others.</p>
<p>12,238.<br />
My mind, do not be<br />
An appreciation-expectation-beggar<br />
If you really need happiness.</p>
<p>12,248.<br />
Be happy and remain happy.<br />
God wants your life;<br />
God needs your heart.</p>
<p>12,382.<br />
The aspiring heart<br />
Always knows in advance<br />
What will make God<br />
Truly happy.</p>
<p>12,438.<br />
God never includes<br />
The doubting mind<br />
In His<br />
Happiness-Heart-Circle.</p>
<p>12,456.<br />
In our heart&#8217;s<br />
Golden light<br />
Abides our mind&#8217;s<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>12,459.<br />
May our heart&#8217;s<br />
Morning happiness<br />
Brighten our entire day.</p>
<p>12,482.<br />
We must not try<br />
To conquer time.<br />
We must utilise time<br />
And flow with it<br />
Happily and cheerfully.</p>
<p>12,530.<br />
Like my soul,<br />
I must also happily accept<br />
My Lord&#8217;s<br />
High Dictatorship.</p>
<p>12,538.<br />
When I am in my peaceful meditation,<br />
It gives me boundless satisfaction<br />
To see somebody else<br />
Really happy.</p>
<p>12,551.<br />
No matter what your mind tells you,<br />
Keep yourself happy, happier<br />
And happiest<br />
In your gratitude-heart-garden.</p>
<p>12,553.<br />
Put all your life&#8217;s problems<br />
Into one huge bundle<br />
And just burn it immediately,<br />
Happily and proudly!</p>
<p>12,601.<br />
God&#8217;s message is only happiness,<br />
And this happiness we can get<br />
From our soulful prayers<br />
And fruitful meditation.</p>
<p>12,602.<br />
If you are divinely happy,<br />
The whole world<br />
Is supremely happy.</p>
<p>12,696.<br />
Unless and until we stop doubting<br />
Our God-fulfilment-capacities,<br />
We shall never be happy.</p>
<p>12,714.<br />
When we worship God&#8217;s Feet<br />
With flowers,<br />
He is truly happy.</p>
<p>12,715.<br />
When we worship God<br />
With our self-giving life,<br />
His Happiness knows no bounds.</p>
<p>12,869.<br />
If you keep yourself busy<br />
Serving God,<br />
God will give you a new name:<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>12,895.<br />
O seeker, catch the mind&#8217;s<br />
Imagination-bird<br />
And feed the heart&#8217;s<br />
Aspiration-flame<br />
To make God happy<br />
In His own Way.</p>
<p>12,904.<br />
If there is constant oneness,<br />
Then happiness<br />
Cannot live elsewhere.</p>
<p>13,097.<br />
If we prayerfully walk<br />
Along any road,<br />
Then ours will be<br />
A happy end:<br />
God.</p>
<p>13,186.<br />
There is only one way<br />
To please God<br />
And that is through<br />
Your own happiness.</p>
<p>13,247.<br />
Happiness is found<br />
In<br />
The willingness-mind.</p>
<p>13,271.<br />
Our heart&#8217;s sincere happiness<br />
Immediately increases<br />
God&#8217;s Sound-Greatness<br />
And<br />
His Silence-Goodness.</p>
<p>13,296.<br />
Happiness shared<br />
Is immediately<br />
Fulness multiplied.</p>
<p>13,306.<br />
Who exactly is God&#8217;s choice?<br />
Whoever sings and plays soulfully,<br />
Happily and proudly<br />
In his heart-garden<br />
Is indeed God&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>13,337.<br />
We may enjoy our laziness,<br />
We may even enjoy<br />
Our madness,<br />
But we must know that God<br />
Is not at all happy about it.</p>
<p>13,465.<br />
Our life&#8217;s happiness-seeds<br />
Are sown<br />
By God&#8217;s own Hand.</p>
<p>13,760.<br />
What am I aspiring for?<br />
The manifestation<br />
Of the Supreme&#8217;s Happiness.</p>
<p>13,798.<br />
How can you be happy?<br />
Do not expect anything from anybody –<br />
Including God.</p>
<p>13,799.<br />
How can you be happy?<br />
Only give and give and give –<br />
Lovingly, soulfully, sleeplessly<br />
And breathlessly.</p>
<p>13,800.<br />
How can you be happy?<br />
Just think of the enormous progress<br />
You have made<br />
Since you have been<br />
In the spiritual life.</p>
<p>13,809.<br />
We must accept<br />
Happily and proudly<br />
All our earth-given responsibilities.</p>
<p>13,813.<br />
Our heart has to be<br />
Always as happy<br />
As the morning rainbow.</p>
<p>13,863.<br />
Happiness-sky is waiting for us.<br />
Alas, our mind is never ready<br />
To want the heart of happiness-life.</p>
<p>13,926.<br />
No happy heart<br />
Can ever suffer long<br />
From the mind&#8217;s negativity-weight.</p>
<p>13,942.<br />
Happily the sun shines,<br />
Happily the wind blows,<br />
Happily my God-hunger grows.</p>
<p>14,069.<br />
I am so happy and proud<br />
That my soul definitely loves<br />
And enjoys<br />
My heart-garden.</p>
<p>14,103.<br />
If you can see and feel your heart-river<br />
Flowing into the vast sea,<br />
You will have true inner happiness.</p>
<p>14,104.<br />
If you have inner happiness—<br />
Not pleasure—<br />
You will never make a mistake.</p>
<p>14,352.<br />
I can be really happy<br />
Only if I can<br />
Most self-givingly follow<br />
My Lord’s Lotus-Feet.</p>
<p>14,666.<br />
Inside your heart<br />
Meditate on the happiest days<br />
Of your inner life.</p>
<p>14,735.<br />
My friend,<br />
Do you know<br />
That God has given you<br />
Your two beautiful eyes<br />
To make me and keep me<br />
Heavenly happy?</p>
<p>14,758.<br />
Bring your heart’s inner happiness<br />
Into your mind.<br />
In the twinkling of an eye<br />
You will be inundated<br />
With inspiration.</p>
<p>14,766.<br />
A day will come<br />
When this world of ours<br />
Will be liberated<br />
From misunderstanding,<br />
Limitations and weaknesses.<br />
It will be a happy, illumining<br />
And fulfilling oneness-family.</p>
<p>14,783.<br />
The soul is happier<br />
When the body is stronger.<br />
The soul will be happier<br />
Than the happiest<br />
If inner aspiration is added<br />
To outer strength.</p>
<p>14,829.<br />
Happiness is<br />
The heart’s great contribution<br />
To life.</p>
<p>14,835.<br />
An unhappy mind<br />
Receives nothing<br />
From Above.</p>
<p>14,836.<br />
A happy face<br />
Receives something<br />
From Above.</p>
<p>14,837.<br />
A happy heart<br />
Receives everything<br />
From Above.</p>
<p>15,009.<br />
True happiness is<br />
In preparing selflessness<br />
And<br />
In destroying selfishness.</p>
<p>15,018.<br />
My mind,<br />
You can do so many things.<br />
Can you not add one thing more?<br />
Just wish everyone happiness.</p>
<p>15,212.<br />
You can be aware of<br />
Your inner progress<br />
By observing the happiness<br />
Inside you.</p>
<p>15,522.<br />
Maintain friendship at any cost!<br />
At times, even your dearest friend<br />
May annoy you, exasperate you<br />
And even enrage you.<br />
Have patience.<br />
Your friend will eventually<br />
Change for the better<br />
And you will be mightily happy.</p>
<p>15,557.<br />
When I try to trust God,<br />
God Himself makes me<br />
Happy.</p>
<p>15,593.<br />
Do not think of happiness.<br />
Just pray for happiness<br />
And grow into<br />
The fragrance-beauty<br />
Of happiness.</p>
<p>15,886.<br />
Real surrender<br />
Means<br />
The heart&#8217;s happiness-roar.</p>
<p>15,969.<br />
O my mind,<br />
Can you not develop<br />
The habit of holiness<br />
To be genuinely happy?</p>
<p>16, 005.<br />
Be happy, be cheerful,<br />
Be self-giving!<br />
Only then God will bless you<br />
With the capacity to climb up<br />
To God’s Heart-Summit.</p>
<p>16,015.<br />
A happiness-flower-heart<br />
Is always found<br />
In a self-offering life.</p>
<p>16,116.<br />
Nobody has the capacity<br />
To take away<br />
Our heart’s happiness,<br />
Save and except<br />
Our God-doubting mind.</p>
<p>16,315.<br />
Unhappiness<br />
Is the result<br />
Of my self-created chains.</p>
<p>16,321.<br />
When I live<br />
An unconditional life,<br />
I enjoy the paradise<br />
Of perfect happiness.</p>
<p>16,348.<br />
Do not fall behind my heart,<br />
O my mind,<br />
If you really want to be happy.</p>
<p>16.374.<br />
Unhappiness broods<br />
Because we do not allow<br />
Happiness to blossom.</p>
<p>16,454.<br />
Not the mind but the heart<br />
Is a genuine authority<br />
On happiness, newness<br />
And fullness.</p>
<p>16,572.<br />
Always happily,<br />
Self-givingly and proudly<br />
Reveal yourself to the heart.</p>
<p>16,722.<br />
My happiness<br />
And God’s Satisfaction<br />
Can never be separated.</p>
<p>16.758.<br />
I call it my self-giving.<br />
God calls the same thing<br />
His Happiness-Pride.</p>
<p>16,843.<br />
God is always eager<br />
To bless me with<br />
His Heart’s Fulness-Happiness,<br />
But alas, I am never ready.</p>
<p>16,846.<br />
May each thought<br />
Produced by my mind<br />
Become a blossoming<br />
Rainbow-happiness.</p>
<p>16,848.<br />
My surrender-life<br />
Is the pioneer<br />
Of my Lord’s Happiness-Heart.</p>
<p>17,153.<br />
A happiness-heart<br />
Knows no sign<br />
Of fatigue.</p>
<p>17,260.<br />
If the proud mind<br />
Does not descend<br />
To the heart-humility-life,<br />
Then the mind is bound<br />
To remain unhappy.</p>
<p>17,269.<br />
I am so happy that my soul<br />
Is extremely strict with me<br />
And gives me no opportunity<br />
To choose anything.</p>
<p>17,287.<br />
Fast, very fast,<br />
Jealousy clips the wings<br />
Of our happiness-heart.</p>
<p>17,378.<br />
When your heart is<br />
Constant self-giving,<br />
Happiness is bound to run<br />
Towards you.</p>
<p>17,527.<br />
Two smiles meet&#8211;<br />
My soul&#8217;s giant smile<br />
And<br />
My heart&#8217;s dwarf smile&#8211;<br />
Happily and proudly.</p>
<p>17,669.<br />
Let happiness be the king<br />
In our inner life of aspiration<br />
And our outer life of dedication.</p>
<p>17,700.<br />
When I love God and serve God,<br />
Immediately I hear the murmur<br />
Of multiple happy voices<br />
Inside my heart.</p>
<p>17,715.<br />
Be careful!<br />
If you run away<br />
With the freedom of your mind,<br />
Soon you will find your happiness-life<br />
Nowhere.</p>
<p>17,799.<br />
My mind always steals happiness<br />
From my heart.<br />
One day, my mind-thief<br />
Will be caught red-handed.</p>
<p>17,924.<br />
Happily we must pay<br />
Our life&#8217;s dues<br />
To the Mother Earth.</p>
<p>17,926.<br />
Happiness always pervades<br />
A true seeker&#8217;s<br />
Godward march.</p>
<p>17,930.<br />
One happy moment<br />
Can erase the bitter frustrations<br />
Of decades.</p>
<p>17,991.<br />
Happiness is the capacity<br />
That we have<br />
To chase away<br />
Our negativity-mind.</p>
<p>17,994.<br />
May each and every heart<br />
Be the murmur<br />
Of happiness-life<br />
And happiness-voice.</p>
<p>18,219.<br />
If you look<br />
Beyond my words,<br />
You will be happy.</p>
<p>18,276.<br />
To make our Lord Supreme happy<br />
In His own Way,<br />
We must destroy all our<br />
Desire-treasures.</p>
<p>18,453.<br />
God wants each and every human being<br />
To learn at least one<br />
Oneness-heart-happiness-song.</p>
<p>18,458.<br />
True,<br />
I had a very hard life,<br />
But it was a happy one.</p>
<p>18,526.<br />
My heart-happiness<br />
Is<br />
My Lord’s Pride-Fulness.</p>
<p>18,657.<br />
Like a child,<br />
Let us take God’s Will<br />
As a toy<br />
And run with it<br />
Happily and proudly.</p>
<p>18,810.<br />
My happiness comes and goes<br />
In waves<br />
Precisely because my God-surrender<br />
Is not complete.</p>
<p>18,898.<br />
Your cheerful meditation<br />
Will make God<br />
The happiest.</p>
<p>18,929.<br />
God is more than happy<br />
To be a humble broomstick<br />
For you to use<br />
To clean your heart-temple.</p>
<p>18,937.<br />
Physical fitness helps<br />
The body, vital, mind and heart<br />
To be happy.</p>
<p>19,184.<br />
Happiness means<br />
The serenity<br />
Of the mind.</p>
<p>19,241.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is<br />
God-manifestation-strength.</p>
<p>19,339.<br />
O my mind, be careful!<br />
God is not happy<br />
With you.</p>
<p>20,112.<br />
At every moment<br />
We need attitude-adjustment<br />
To make God happy.</p>
<p>20,113.<br />
Happiness is freedom,<br />
And freedom<br />
Is self-giving.</p>
<p>21,051.<br />
If you take even one single step<br />
Beyond the confines of the mind,<br />
Your happiness<br />
Will know no bounds.</p>
<p>21,305.<br />
Do not compare<br />
If you want to be happy.<br />
Do not blame<br />
If you want to be happy.</p>
<p>21,306.<br />
Happiness disappears<br />
The moment we pursue<br />
Name and fame.</p>
<p>21,326.<br />
O my mind,<br />
If you want to be wise,<br />
Then start immediately to unlearn,<br />
For there are many things to unlearn<br />
If you want to have happiness.</p>
<p>21,339.<br />
To be happy<br />
Do not try to understand<br />
The world,<br />
But try to be useful<br />
To the world.</p>
<p>21,360.<br />
Forget the misdeeds of others.<br />
Forgive your own misdeeds.<br />
Lo, happiness is all yours.</p>
<p>21,393.<br />
Happiness is found<br />
Only in the vision-eye<br />
Of courage.</p>
<p>21,462.<br />
My heart&#8217;s real name<br />
Is happiness-contribution<br />
To the whole world.</p>
<p>21,475.<br />
Happiness is composed of<br />
A simplicity-mind,<br />
A sincerity-heart<br />
And a purity-life.</p>
<p>21,563.<br />
A life surrendered<br />
To God-Happiness<br />
Is a one-way street.</p>
<p>21,586.<br />
O my mind,<br />
Burn the past.<br />
You will not only be happy<br />
But also perfect.</p>
<p>21,811.<br />
The time to be really happy<br />
Is now,<br />
Here at the very place<br />
Where you are.</p>
<p>21,891.<br />
To please God<br />
And to offer Him happiness<br />
At every moment,<br />
What I need is utmost eagerness<br />
In my aspiration-heart.</p>
<p>21,907.<br />
If you cannot laugh<br />
At your stupidity,<br />
It will be difficult for you<br />
To be really happy.</p>
<p>21,928.<br />
Every day<br />
God asks my heart<br />
To spread<br />
Happiness-divinity.</p>
<p>21,963.<br />
There is only one time<br />
To be happy,<br />
And that time<br />
Is now!</p>
<p>22,021.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is the beginning<br />
Of self-confidence.</p>
<p>22,034.<br />
Happiness and courage<br />
Feed each other.</p>
<p>22,236.<br />
If you want to be truly happy,<br />
Be not fearful<br />
But be joyful<br />
On the strength of your self-giving.</p>
<p>22,286.<br />
To make yourself happy,<br />
Confess your blunders<br />
Before you face any criticism.</p>
<p>22,407.<br />
Another name<br />
For trust<br />
Is happiness.</p>
<p>22,473.<br />
Our happiness<br />
Gladdens and charms God<br />
More than anything else.</p>
<p>22,484.<br />
There is a special way<br />
To thank God,<br />
And that way is<br />
To keep myself always happy.</p>
<p>22,615.<br />
To have a glance<br />
From God&#8217;s Eye<br />
Is, indeed,<br />
A rare moment of happiness.</p>
<p>22,985.<br />
God-happiness we find<br />
Not when we enter<br />
The heart-temple,<br />
Not when we are seated inside<br />
The heart-temple,<br />
But only when we pray and meditate<br />
Inside the heart-temple.</p>
<p>23,128.<br />
God wants me to be really happy.<br />
Therefore, He has destroyed<br />
All my expectation-mind-cages.</p>
<p>23,217.<br />
God will love you<br />
Infinitely more<br />
If you share with the world<br />
Your God-given happiness.</p>
<p>23,359.<br />
We must make ourselves happy<br />
No matter what happens.</p>
<p>23,360.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is an inner product<br />
And not an outer product.</p>
<p>23,490.<br />
I am collecting happiness-hearts<br />
To give satisfaction<br />
To my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>23,524.<br />
Without happiness<br />
In our meditation<br />
We cannot make<br />
Satisfactory progress.</p>
<p>23,677.<br />
If you want to be happy,<br />
Open, inside your heart,<br />
God&#8217;s Forgiveness-Present.</p>
<p>23,887.<br />
Only my happiness in the inner world<br />
And<br />
God&#8217;s Happiness in the higher world<br />
Can be of great service<br />
To mankind.</p>
<p>23,903.<br />
Happily every morning<br />
My heart reaches out<br />
Towards the Will<br />
Of my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>23.973.<br />
Happiness is our return<br />
To our long-sought<br />
Heaven-home.</p>
<p>24,050.<br />
There is only one wisdom:<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>24,079.<br />
Happiness comes from<br />
Self-giving,<br />
And from nowhere else.</p>
<p>24,469.<br />
When my Lord is in full control,<br />
I become<br />
The happiest God-seeker.</p>
<p>24,478.<br />
It is I who create my happiness<br />
By virtue of<br />
My constant self-giving.</p>
<p>24,650.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is not only within us<br />
But is also universal.</p>
<p>24,843.<br />
The best possible way<br />
To thank God<br />
Is to keep ourselves happy.</p>
<p>24,955.<br />
When we ask God for devotion,<br />
We make Him<br />
Happier than the happiest<br />
And<br />
Prouder than the proudest.</p>
<p>25,000.<br />
A divinely happy mind<br />
Means<br />
Supremely fast progress<br />
In our spiritual life.</p>
<p>25,059.<br />
The outer search<br />
For happiness<br />
Is a fruitless search.</p>
<p>25,116.<br />
To make myself happy,<br />
I live far beyond the domain<br />
Of expectation.</p>
<p>25,265.<br />
Be happy!<br />
Be happy!<br />
You will always have time<br />
To be unhappy later.</p>
<p>25,267.<br />
The mind<br />
Suspects happiness.</p>
<p>25,268.<br />
The heart<br />
Creates happiness.</p>
<p>25,270.<br />
When we are happy,<br />
We go far beyond<br />
The limitation-boundaries.</p>
<p>25,479.<br />
A sun-bright happiness-life<br />
Can be achieved<br />
Through constant self-offering.</p>
<p>25,514.<br />
This morning<br />
God came and gave me<br />
The capacity to turn<br />
Each and every turmoil<br />
Into happiness.</p>
<p>25,618.<br />
My aspiration-heart<br />
Is happy to house<br />
Everything that I need<br />
For God-realisation.</p>
<p>25,688.<br />
Happiness-beauty<br />
Is ready to welcome the heart<br />
At any time.</p>
<p>25,701.<br />
To smile<br />
Is to offer happiness<br />
To the world.</p>
<p>26,192.<br />
If you are divinely happy,<br />
Then anything you do<br />
Becomes part and parcel<br />
Of your meditation.</p>
<p>26,267.<br />
A gratitude-heart<br />
Means<br />
A true happiness-life.</p>
<p>26,432.<br />
When I am happy,<br />
The whole world<br />
Prospers.</p>
<p>26,433.<br />
When I am unhappy,<br />
The whole world<br />
Helplessly descends.</p>
<p>26,445.<br />
Only be happy, happier and happiest.<br />
If you can make yourself happy,<br />
God will give you one hundred<br />
Out of one hundred.</p>
<p>26,461.<br />
Happiness comes<br />
From renunciation,<br />
And not from possession.</p>
<p>26,475.<br />
A heart-singer<br />
Is<br />
A newness-happiness-bringer.</p>
<p>26,566.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is self-giving<br />
With no strings attached.</p>
<p>26,669.<br />
A brief flash<br />
Of inner happiness<br />
Can awaken us fully<br />
To our Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>26,720.<br />
We must get happiness<br />
By helping others first.<br />
Only then will our happiness<br />
Have true meaning.</p>
<p>26,741.<br />
Like my soul,<br />
I must develop universal sympathy<br />
If I really want happiness<br />
From my life.</p>
<p>26,766.<br />
I am so happy<br />
That my mind has now become<br />
The beginner<br />
Of a oneness-life.</p>
<p>26,939.<br />
God wants me to count<br />
All the bad things<br />
That I have given up<br />
To make God exceptionally happy.</p>
<p>27,122.<br />
I must be equally happy<br />
With my Lord&#8217;s<br />
Appreciation and criticism.</p>
<p>27,174.<br />
A heart of compassion<br />
Is the real possessor<br />
Of happiness.</p>
<p>27,236.<br />
God has only one task:<br />
To make us happy<br />
And keep us happy.</p>
<p>27,321.<br />
We can be happy<br />
Only when we practise<br />
Non-expectation.</p>
<p>27, 385.<br />
The age-old mind<br />
Has<br />
No happiness.</p>
<p>27,386.<br />
A child-heart<br />
Is<br />
Happiness incarnate.</p>
<p>27,435.<br />
My only concern<br />
Is to see that happiness<br />
Is spreading everywhere.</p>
<p>27,460.<br />
I came into the world<br />
To swim in the happiness-sea,<br />
And not to climb up<br />
Unhappiness-mountain.</p>
<p>27,518.<br />
My soul advises my heart<br />
Always to remain happy,<br />
No matter what happens<br />
In my outer life.</p>
<p>27,526.<br />
The heart wants to spread<br />
Happiness-breath<br />
Everywhere.</p>
<p>27,550.<br />
The songs of a happy heart<br />
Are as strong<br />
As citadels.</p>
<p>27,588.<br />
Unhappiness brings us<br />
Destructive messages<br />
From evil worlds.</p>
<p>27,772.<br />
God wants<br />
Each and every human being<br />
To have<br />
A happiness-flooded heart.</p>
<p>27,803.<br />
Meditation<br />
Is the only thing<br />
That gives a true seeker happiness.</p>
<p>27, 897.<br />
My heart is longing<br />
For a bountiful life<br />
Of inner happiness.</p>
<p>27,965.<br />
We must happily, proudly<br />
Plus confidently<br />
Leave everything<br />
At the Feet of God.</p>
<p>28,115.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is on the top<br />
Of God&#8217;s Priority List.</p>
<p>28,137.<br />
God has been asking me<br />
Time and again:<br />
&#8220;My child, are you happy?<br />
My child, when will you<br />
Be happy once more?&#8221;</p>
<p>28,149.<br />
I must share my happiness<br />
With the rest of the world<br />
To make my life<br />
Meaningful and fruitful.</p>
<p>28,234.<br />
Not the proudest mind<br />
But the happiest heart<br />
Wins the Godward race.</p>
<p>28,239.<br />
A seeker&#8217;s happiness-heart<br />
Has a free access<br />
To God&#8217;s Heaven-Home.</p>
<p>28,515.<br />
The inner happiness<br />
Never depends on<br />
Outer happenings.</p>
<p>28,716.<br />
If my life is really<br />
A God-service,<br />
Then there can be<br />
No unhappiness.</p>
<p>28,786.<br />
Only genuine happiness<br />
Counts<br />
In the inner life.</p>
<p>28,808.<br />
When we are happy,<br />
The outer world<br />
Is our friend.</p>
<p>28,853.<br />
Take your life out of<br />
Your unhappiness-mind-prison.</p>
<p>29,059.<br />
Neither happiness<br />
Nor unhappiness,<br />
But only God&#8217;s Will,<br />
Ultimately prevails.</p>
<p>29,109.<br />
When I share<br />
My happiness,<br />
I multiply it.</p>
<p>29,344.<br />
My inner happiness<br />
Cures<br />
My outer suffering.</p>
<p>29,507.<br />
A happiness-heart<br />
Knows how to blend<br />
And how to bend<br />
At any time.</p>
<p>29,740.<br />
If we can be happy<br />
In the happiness of others,<br />
Then God is really acting<br />
In and through us.</p>
<p>29,742.<br />
Promise-fulfillers<br />
Are God’s happiest<br />
And proudest choice.</p>
<p>29,760.<br />
Patience and happiness<br />
Can easily create<br />
The miracle of miracles:<br />
Man’s victory over ignorance-night.</p>
<p>30,180.<br />
May everything that I have<br />
And I am<br />
Happily bow<br />
To my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>30,311.<br />
To be really free,<br />
We must make others happy.</p>
<p>30,415.<br />
If you really want to be happy<br />
In your life,<br />
Then pray to God<br />
To give you the capacity<br />
To be only on His Side<br />
All the time.</p>
<p>30,453.<br />
Happiness strengthens<br />
Our spiritual health.</p>
<p>30,604.<br />
God tells me<br />
Not to waste my time<br />
In thinking of repaying Him.<br />
He just wants me to remain happy.</p>
<p>30,812.<br />
My Lord is so happy<br />
That I am not standing<br />
On the complaint-line any more.</p>
<p>30,987.<br />
Forget the past,<br />
Forget!<br />
You will be happy.</p>
<p>30,988.<br />
Remember the present,<br />
Remember!<br />
You will be happy.</p>
<p>30,989.<br />
Surrender the future,<br />
Surrender!<br />
You will be happy.</p>
<p>31,067.<br />
A wee smile is needed<br />
To make my Lord happy.</p>
<p>31,203.<br />
Meditation means<br />
Radiation of happiness.</p>
<p>31,702.<br />
I must structure<br />
My daily activities<br />
Lovingly, soulfully and carefully<br />
To make my Lord Supreme happy.</p>
<p>31,731.<br />
My mind cares<br />
For happiness.<br />
My heart cares<br />
For holiness.</p>
<p>31,748.<br />
I need more,<br />
Infinitely more happiness<br />
Inside my heart<br />
To please my Lord<br />
At every moment.</p>
<p>31,787.<br />
My gratitude-heart<br />
Can only create for me<br />
A happiness-universe.</p>
<p>31,862.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is<br />
A God-blossoming rose.</p>
<p>31,955.<br />
Only a true God-lover<br />
Can remain always happy.</p>
<p>31,985.<br />
Only a happiness-smile<br />
From our heart<br />
Can cure our outer life.</p>
<p>31,991.<br />
When we are happy,<br />
We scatter peace-petals<br />
Everywhere.</p>
<p>32,094.<br />
To be happy<br />
The fighter in me<br />
Must surrender<br />
To the lover in me.</p>
<p>32,229.<br />
The happiest day of my life<br />
Was when I banished<br />
All my expectations.</p>
<p>32,343.<br />
Material happiness<br />
Is short-lived<br />
And very shallow.</p>
<p>32,406.<br />
Service<br />
Is the secret<br />
Of true happiness.</p>
<p>32,487.<br />
God wants me to be proud of myself,<br />
For I am happily and unreservedly<br />
Giving Him the chance<br />
To unfold my aspiration-heart.</p>
<p>32,877.<br />
My Lord smiles and smiles<br />
And becomes extremely proud of me<br />
When He sees me sincerely happy.</p>
<p>33,049.<br />
When I see clearly<br />
That my Lord does not need me,<br />
Yet He showers me with His Blessings,<br />
Affection, Love and Sweetness,<br />
I become happier than the happiest.</p>
<p>33,448.<br />
God happily and proudly<br />
Helps us<br />
When we want to turn<br />
Our stumbling blocks<br />
Into stepping stones.</p>
<p>33,628.<br />
Happiness comes<br />
And happiness goes &#8211;<br />
It entirely depends on<br />
The ebb and flow<br />
Of my consciousness-tide.</p>
<p>33,784.<br />
The disciple&#8217;s happiness<br />
Is the Master&#8217;s highest pride.</p>
<p>34,005.<br />
Happiness is the only medicine<br />
That can brighten our hearts<br />
And enlighten our minds.</p>
<p>34,144.<br />
When I think<br />
Of God,<br />
I am happy.</p>
<p>34,325.<br />
The supreme happiness<br />
In my life<br />
Is when my Master gives me<br />
A most powerful smile.</p>
<p>34,662.<br />
I must practise what I preach.<br />
This is the only way<br />
I can make my Lord<br />
Divinely and supremely happy.</p>
<p>34,829.<br />
Smile, smile, smile!<br />
Happiness will endear you<br />
To both God and man.</p>
<p>34,861.<br />
Do not blame the mind-<br />
Tame the mind.<br />
You will be supremely happy.</p>
<p>35,018.<br />
The philosophy<br />
Of a reasoning mind<br />
Is happiness starvation.</p>
<p>35,083.<br />
I am so happy<br />
That I can no longer see<br />
My unaspiring past.</p>
<p>35,094.<br />
How can we make God<br />
Supremely happy<br />
If we do not bravely unearth<br />
Our endless potential?</p>
<p>35,200.<br />
Even God hesitates<br />
To deal with my mind’s<br />
Unhappiness-night.</p>
<p>35,252.<br />
I must see the world<br />
Through my heart-eye<br />
So that I can always remain happy.</p>
<p>35,267.<br />
From age to age<br />
God comes into the world<br />
Only to see His creations happy.</p>
<p>35,393.<br />
God wants us to do only two things:<br />
To live and work,<br />
Self-givingly and happily,<br />
Here on this earth.</p>
<p>35,478.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is the greatest victory<br />
Over ignorance-night.</p>
<p>35,541.<br />
Alas, when we cry<br />
For happiness,<br />
Unhappiness presents itself.</p>
<p>35,603.<br />
To be happy,<br />
We must erase<br />
Our desire-steps.</p>
<p>35,670.<br />
We must clasp happiness<br />
In the fleeting moments<br />
Of life.</p>
<p>35,706.<br />
Indomitable inner strength<br />
Is needed<br />
To keep us happy<br />
In our outer life.</p>
<p>35,713.<br />
Self-offering is the only way<br />
To make us, and keep us,<br />
Happy.</p>
<p>35,753.<br />
Do not judge,<br />
But love and be loved,<br />
If you want to be really happy.</p>
<p>35,756.<br />
Courage and happiness<br />
Are like the beauty<br />
And the fragrance<br />
Of the heart-rose.</p>
<p>35,780.<br />
If you are constantly afraid<br />
Of death,<br />
Then you can never<br />
Live happily.</p>
<p>35,790.<br />
If you do not forgive yourself,<br />
Then peace and happiness<br />
Will remain a far cry.</p>
<p>35,797.<br />
If you show God<br />
Your happy heart,<br />
God is bound to show you<br />
His Pride-Heart.</p>
<p>36,073.<br />
Forgiveness and happiness<br />
Shall forever remain<br />
Inseparable.</p>
<p>36,087.<br />
Serve God,<br />
Be happy,<br />
Remain happy.<br />
Do not mind who gets the credit!</p>
<p>36,297.<br />
Happiness is needed<br />
When we play with the world.</p>
<p>36,323.<br />
O seeker,<br />
You will be so happy<br />
If you become your buried pride.</p>
<p>36,841.<br />
Every day<br />
We must try<br />
To make at least one person<br />
Happy.</p>
<p>36,891.<br />
Happy thoughts<br />
Keep even the mind<br />
Very strong.</p>
<p>37,118.<br />
To kindle happiness-candles<br />
Everywhere,<br />
We came into the world.</p>
<p>37,140.<br />
My happiness<br />
Is my healthiest<br />
Achievement.</p>
<p>37,215.<br />
Do not look at the gift,<br />
But look at the gift-giver,<br />
To make yourself<br />
Unimaginably happy.</p>
<p>37,517.<br />
I am so happy that my past<br />
Has no capacity<br />
To interest me.</p>
<p>37,518.<br />
I am so happy<br />
That I have brought down<br />
The future<br />
Into my today’s life.</p>
<p>37,636.<br />
Happiness<br />
Brightens<br />
The mind.</p>
<p>37,637.<br />
Happiness<br />
Sweetens<br />
The heart.</p>
<p>37,638.<br />
Happiness<br />
Enlightens<br />
The life.</p>
<p>38,103.<br />
My love of God<br />
Is very insignificant,<br />
But my life entirely depends on Him.<br />
Therefore, I am very happy.</p>
<p>38,114.<br />
I do not have to know where I am going<br />
Or how many more years I will need<br />
To be a totally unconditional seeker.<br />
I am just extremely happy<br />
To be in the Boat<br />
Of my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>38,288.<br />
God tells me that,<br />
Until my surrender becomes happy<br />
He cannot accept me as His own.</p>
<p>38,292.<br />
My Lord,<br />
How can I make You truly happy?<br />
&#8220;My child,<br />
First make yourself happy<br />
In a divine way.<br />
I shall then immediately be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>38,441.<br />
The heart is the only place<br />
Where happiness<br />
Can easily be found.</p>
<p>38,656.<br />
May my life be<br />
An unbroken happiness-flow,<br />
By God&#8217;s infinite Blessings.</p>
<p>38,788.<br />
When I listen<br />
To my heart,<br />
It is all unbounded happiness.</p>
<p>38,816.<br />
Only a happy thought<br />
Can transform<br />
The mind.</p>
<p>38,864.<br />
One happy smile<br />
From my heart<br />
Makes my Lord&#8217;s Heart<br />
Very rich.</p>
<p>38,872.<br />
A bright thought<br />
Means<br />
A happy mind.</p>
<p>38,950.<br />
Unless I remain<br />
At my Lord&#8217;s Feet,<br />
I am never happy<br />
And never safe.</p>
<p>39,025.<br />
The undivine forces<br />
Are terribly afraid of<br />
The supremely happy hearts.</p>
<p>39,090.<br />
Unless we discard<br />
Our competitive spirit,<br />
We will never be happy.</p>
<p>39,151.<br />
My Lord,<br />
How I wish I could count<br />
The number of times<br />
You have made me,<br />
My heart, my entire being,<br />
Happy<br />
In a very celestial way!</p>
<p>39,174.<br />
A heart of tranquillity<br />
Is a source<br />
Of tremendous happiness.</p>
<p>39,383.<br />
My Lord,<br />
Do You know that I am extremely happy<br />
With my aspiration-heart<br />
And my dedication-life?<br />
&#8220;My child,<br />
Perhaps I have something to do with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>39,454.<br />
We expect everything from God-<br />
Celestial and terrestial-<br />
But God expects only one thing from us:<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>39,471.<br />
When I am happy,<br />
Heaven<br />
Is just next door.</p>
<p>39,474.<br />
When I am happy,<br />
I see absolutely nothing wrong<br />
In this world.</p>
<p>39,476.<br />
When I am happy,<br />
I do not mind<br />
If each and every human being<br />
Goes ahead of me,<br />
For I have established my oneness<br />
With them.</p>
<p>39,581.<br />
God expects from us<br />
Only the things<br />
That will make Him happy.</p>
<p>39,602.<br />
When a happiness-heart<br />
Sings,<br />
It is most haunting.</p>
<p>39,689.<br />
The outer run<br />
Makes our mind and vital<br />
Very happy.</p>
<p>39,789.<br />
When I have good thoughts<br />
During the day,<br />
My Lord tells me<br />
That His Happiness knows no bounds.</p>
<p>39,850.<br />
Unless I can convince myself<br />
That my Lord&#8217;s Grace<br />
Is everything,<br />
I shall not be happy<br />
And I shall never make<br />
Anybody happy.</p>
<p>40,048.<br />
My happiness-smile<br />
Is the only thing<br />
That God wants from me<br />
All the time.</p>
<p>40,541.<br />
Those who run after happiness<br />
Will never be happy.<br />
Happiness is something<br />
That has to come to the fore<br />
From within.</p>
<p>40,590.<br />
Unless I surrender unconditionally<br />
To God&#8217;s Will,<br />
Happiness will remain<br />
A far cry.</p>
<p>40,816.<br />
God wants<br />
To see us happy<br />
All the time.</p>
<p>40,817.<br />
We want<br />
To make God happy<br />
All the time.</p>
<p>40,906.<br />
God wants me to strike<br />
My heart-happiness-gong<br />
Every hour.</p>
<p>41,180.<br />
My Lord,<br />
What gives You more joy:<br />
When I pray to You or when I work for You?<br />
&#8220;My child,<br />
When you sincerely pray<br />
And when you self-givingly work,<br />
I am equally happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>41,216.<br />
O seeker,<br />
You can easily know<br />
From your own love of God<br />
If God is really happy<br />
With your aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p>41,327.<br />
Humility<br />
Soulfully follows<br />
Happiness.</p>
<p>41,328.<br />
Happiness<br />
Unconditionally follows<br />
Humility.</p>
<p>41,382.<br />
God is unhappy<br />
When we speak ill of<br />
Others.</p>
<p>41,482.<br />
Forgive to be happy.<br />
Forget the sad experience<br />
To be permanently happy.</p>
<p>41,642.<br />
My heart&#8217;s aspiration-river<br />
Always carries<br />
My life&#8217;s happiness-boat.</p>
<p>41,767.<br />
To see God happy<br />
Is more difficult<br />
In the inner world<br />
Than in the outer world.</p>
<p>41,811.<br />
Happiness<br />
And the aspiration-heart<br />
Cannot live<br />
Without each other.</p>
<p>41,834.<br />
Happily, unreservedly<br />
And unconditionally<br />
Accept any part given by God<br />
In His Cosmic Play.</p>
<p>41,872.<br />
My Lord,<br />
Dogs and horses sacrifice their lives<br />
Willingly, happily and proudly<br />
For their masters.<br />
How is it that I cannot sacrifice my life,<br />
Even for a single day,<br />
To please my Master?</p>
<p>41,924.<br />
I make my Lord very happy<br />
And very proud of me<br />
When I stop thinking<br />
Of others&#8217; defects.</p>
<p>42,007.<br />
The children of happiness<br />
Will create a new world.</p>
<p>42,022.<br />
Faith means<br />
Inclusion of the world,<br />
Happily and proudly.</p>
<p>42,153.<br />
When I pray to God to make me happy,<br />
He laughs and laughs and laughs.<br />
He says to me:<br />
“My child, tell Me frankly<br />
When, where and how you are unhappy.<br />
I shall make you happy<br />
Only when you are ready to feel<br />
That I shall do everything for you.<br />
You do not have to worry at all.”</p>
<p>42,265.<br />
God tells me:<br />
“My child, I am happy that My Greatness<br />
Attracts your attention.<br />
I am happy that My Goodness<br />
Attracts your attention.<br />
But My Oneness with you,<br />
In your outer life and inner life,<br />
Should attract your attention<br />
Infinitely more.”</p>
<p>42,346.<br />
God is always happy.<br />
Why?<br />
Because he claims everybody<br />
As His own, very own.</p>
<p>42,409.<br />
I want to be<br />
God’s chosen slave<br />
To make myself absolutely happy.</p>
<p>42,510.<br />
Not by accusing the world<br />
But by excusing the world<br />
Can we have true happiness.</p>
<p>42,513.<br />
Just to make me happy,<br />
My Lord tells me<br />
That He badly needs a partner.</p>
<p>42,876.<br />
I am so happy<br />
That my Lord does not allow me<br />
To choose –<br />
He does the choosing for me.</p>
<p>42,925.<br />
Happiness is the magnet<br />
That lifts us high above.</p>
<p>42,999.<br />
Every morning God sends<br />
His Happiness-Messenger to us<br />
To speed us towards our Goal,<br />
With no fear.</p>
<p>43,039.<br />
We all were extremely happy<br />
Before the birth<br />
Of our minds.</p>
<p>43,110.<br />
When I make progress<br />
In my spiritual life,<br />
I hear the happiest applause<br />
Of angels.</p>
<p>43,510.<br />
Everyone cannot be first.<br />
But everyone can and must<br />
Join the cosmic Game<br />
To make the Lord Supreme happy.</p>
<p>43,532.<br />
Just try one day<br />
Without finding fault<br />
With any human being.<br />
You will see that happiness<br />
Will become your name.</p>
<p>43,595.<br />
O my mind,<br />
You are trying to be good.<br />
I am happy!<br />
I am sure from now on<br />
God will make you<br />
Better and better.</p>
<p>43,664.<br />
Selflessness takes us<br />
To the heart<br />
Of happiness.</p>
<p>43,732.<br />
Happiness<br />
Looms large<br />
In forgiveness.</p>
<p>43,762.<br />
Where is happiness?<br />
Is it in the blue sky?<br />
Is it in the green field?<br />
Or is it something that remains<br />
Always inside my dreams?</p>
<p>43,874.<br />
We are destined to be happy<br />
And remain happy<br />
In God’s own Way.</p>
<p>43,934.<br />
I strive to remain<br />
Self-givingly happy.</p>
<p>44,001.<br />
To my greatest happiness,<br />
My Lord&#8217;s Footsteps<br />
Are decorating<br />
All my heart-home-rooms.</p>
<p>44,699.<br />
My Lord wants<br />
To break my head<br />
To make me happy.</p>
<p>45,022<br />
Happiness depends<br />
Only on self-giving<br />
And not on anything else.</p>
<p>45,070<br />
Those who do not expect anything<br />
From the world<br />
Are the happiest human beings<br />
On earth.</p>
<p>45,159<br />
All happy hearts on earth<br />
Have given me<br />
Their protection-shelter.</p>
<p>45,764.<br />
All along<br />
I have been dying<br />
For my happiness.<br />
From now on<br />
I shall choose only<br />
My Lord&#8217;s Happiness.</p>
<p>45,827.<br />
Happiness we long for,<br />
But we must know that<br />
Without oneness<br />
We can never have<br />
Abiding happiness.</p>
<p>45,892.<br />
God-obedience<br />
Means happiness<br />
In the entire being.</p>
<p>46,039.<br />
The aspiration-heart<br />
Wants to unite the world<br />
To see God happy.</p>
<p>46,315.<br />
A happy heart<br />
Twinkles<br />
With the Love of God.</p>
<p>46,409.<br />
The heart can become happy<br />
The moment it wants to,<br />
Because the heart is all love<br />
For God.</p>
<p>46,830.<br />
The days of happiness<br />
Are ahead of us<br />
And not behind us.</p>
<p>47,000.<br />
When God is above me,<br />
I am happy.<br />
When God is ahead of me,<br />
I am happy.<br />
When God is around me,<br />
I am happy.<br />
No matter where God is in my life,<br />
I am happy.</p>
<p>47,249.<br />
He who wants happiness<br />
In this world<br />
Must sleeplessly practise<br />
Forgiveness.</p>
<p>47,321.<br />
Do not judge.<br />
Happiness will be all yours.</p>
<p>47,349.<br />
To make others happy,<br />
Alas, why do you not show<br />
Kindness?</p>
<p>47,397.<br />
I am so happy to have friends<br />
Above, below, within<br />
And without.</p>
<p>47,816.<br />
My heart<br />
Happily moves<br />
Around the world.</p>
<p>48,947.<br />
Happiness, happiness, happiness!<br />
Is it a dream or a reality,<br />
Or shall I have to invent it?</p>
<p>49,260.<br />
When God thinks of me,<br />
I become immediately happy.</p>
<p>49,303.<br />
Happiness<br />
Is never to be found<br />
In my mind&#8217;s complaints.</p>
<p>49,318.<br />
We can become happy<br />
Only be seeing<br />
The good and divine qualities<br />
Of each and every human being.</p>
<p>49,373.<br />
My Lord, please allow me-<br />
Happily, cheerfully,<br />
Unconditionally and eternally-<br />
To be Your own, very own.</p>
<p>49,483.<br />
Be always<br />
As happy as possible &#8211;<br />
This is the only thing<br />
That God wants from you.</p>
<p>49,626.<br />
A happy heart<br />
Does not compete.</p>
<p>49,907.<br />
What will mould my future life,<br />
If not my happy acceptance<br />
Of God&#8217;s Will?</p>
